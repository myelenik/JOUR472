## Introduction

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, Thousands of kids are missing from school. Where did they go? (<https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html>)

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data.

```{r}
# Load required data

population_by_age <- read.csv('data/population-by-age.csv') |>
  clean_names()
private_enrollment_by_grade <- read.csv('data/private-enrollment-by-grade.csv') |>
  clean_names()
public_enrollment_by_grade <- read.csv('data/public-enrollment-by-grade.csv') |>
  clean_names() 
missing_kids_analysis <- read.csv('data/Missing-Kids-Analysis.csv') |>
  clean_names()
school_aged_population_changes <- read.csv('data/School-Aged-Population-Changes.csv') |>
  clean_names()
enrollment_changes <- read.csv('data/Enrollment-Changes.csv') |>
  clean_names()


# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 


```

## Sentences to Engineer

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

-   **Sentence text**: "Overall, public school enrollment fell by over 700,000 students between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years in the 21 states plus Washington, D.C., that provided the necessary data."
-   **Analysis summary**: We utilized data from the data set 'enrollment_changes' and compared it to the data set 'missing_kids_analysis'. We were able to find the number of children who left public schools between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years, and it matched the number featured in the story.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

enrollment_changes |>
  group_by(enrollment_type) |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Public school enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  summarise(sum(total_change))

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 2

-   **Sentence text**: "Those states saw private-school enrollment grow by over 100,000 students. Home-schooling grew even more, surging by more than 180,000 from 2019-2020 to 2021-2022."
-   **Analysis summary**: We used the enrollment_changes data set to find the differences is private/homeschooled kids between the 2019 school year and the 2021 school year, confirming the private school enrollment did grow by over 100,000 students and home-schooling did grow by more than 180,000 students.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Private enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  summarise(sum(total_change))
  

enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Homeschool enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  summarize(sum(total_change))

```

### Sentence 3

-   **Sentence text**: "California alone showed over 150,000 missing students in the data, and New York had nearly 60,000."
-   **Analysis summary**: We combined the public enrollment changes, nonpublic enrollment changes and school-aged population changes in New York and California and got a total for missing students in both states.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
public_enrollment_changes <- enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Public school enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY') |>
  select(state,total_change)

non_public_enrollment_changes <- enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Total nonpublic enrollment (private + homeschool)') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY') |>
  select(state,total_change)

enrollment_changes_ca_ny <- non_public_enrollment_changes |>
  inner_join(public_enrollment_changes, by = 'state')

school_age_change <- school_aged_population_changes |>
  filter(state == 'California' | state == 'New York') |>
  select(state,change_in_school_aged_population_5_17)

age_enrollment_change <- enrollment_changes_ca_ny |>
  inner_join(school_age_change, by = 'state') |>
  rename(public_enrollment_change = total_change.x) |>
  rename(nonpublic_enrollment_change = total_change.y) |>
  mutate(total_state_change = (public_enrollment_change + nonpublic_enrollment_change - change_in_school_aged_population_5_17))
  

# Display results of code below this codeblock
age_enrollment_change
```

### Sentence 4

-   **Sentence text**: "The population of school-age kids in the states we studied fell by about 183,000, according to census estimates."
-   **Analysis summary**: We were able to confirm this number by filtering through the states analyzed and summarizing the appropriate column.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
school_aged_population_changes |>
  filter(state == 'California' | state == 'New York' | state == 'Louisiana' | state == 'North Carolina' | state == 'Washington' | state == 'Colorado' | state == 'Georgia' | state == 'Minnesota' | state == 'Wisconsin' | state == 'New Hampshire' | state == 'Massachusetts' | state == 'Montana' | state == 'Delaware' | state == 'North Dakota' | state == 'District of Columbia' | state == 'South Dakota' | state == 'South Carolina' | state == 'Nebraska' | state == 'Rhode Island' | state == 'Tennessee' | state == 'Pennsylvania' | state == 'Florida') |>
  summarize(sum(change_in_school_aged_population_5_17))
# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 5

-   **Sentence text**: An analysis by The Associated Press, Stanford University's Big Local News project and Stanford education professor Thomas Dee found an estimated 230,000 students in 21 states whose absences could not be accounted for.
-   **Analysis summary**: We filtered through every state in the analysis and determined the public enrollment change, nonpublic enrollment change and school-aged population change for each state. We then joined the table to create one big database with each number and mutated to created a new column with the total change in each state. We then summarized that column and got a number that matched the estimation of 230,000.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
total_public_enrollment_changes <- enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Public school enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  select(state,total_change)

total_non_public_enrollment_changes <- enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Total nonpublic enrollment (private + homeschool)') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  select(state,total_change)

total_enrollment_changes <- total_non_public_enrollment_changes |>
  inner_join(total_public_enrollment_changes, by = 'state')

total_school_age_change <- school_aged_population_changes |>
  filter(state == 'California' | state == 'New York' | state == 'Louisiana' | state == 'North Carolina' | state == 'Washington' | state == 'Colorado' | state == 'Georgia' | state == 'Minnesota' | state == 'Wisconsin' | state == 'New Hampshire' | state == 'Massachusetts' | state == 'Montana' | state == 'Delaware' | state == 'North Dakota' | state == 'District of Columbia' | state == 'South Dakota' | state == 'South Carolina' | state == 'Nebraska' | state == 'Rhode Island' | state == 'Tennessee' | state == 'Pennsylvania' | state == 'Florida') |>

  rename(total_public_enrollment_change = total_change.x) |>
  rename(total_nonpublic_enrollment_change = total_change.y) |>
  mutate(total_state_change = (total_public_enrollment_change + total_nonpublic_enrollment_change - change_in_school_aged_population_5_17)) |>
  summarise(missing_kids = sum(total_state_change))

# Display results of code below this codeblock
total_age_enrollment_change
